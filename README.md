Obsidian Moon Engine
====================

This is a project that I have worked on for several years after wanting a completely modular framework. I am aiming for 
lightweight and able to include any modules from other applications, etc.

## Installing Obsidian Moon Engine

Since Obsidian Moon Engine uses [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) you will need to install it before you can run the
code with it. Once you have installed Composer you will then be able to install it by running the following command:

```bash
composer require obsidian-moon/engine
``` 

Alternatively, you can install the [Obsidian Moon Framework](/obsidian-moon/framework) with a prebuilt structure,
by using the following command. Click the link for additional information.

```bash
composer create-project obsidian-moon/framework
```

## Summary of Obsidian Moon Engine

You will find that the Obsidian Moon Engine is 100% modular and will expand as you build code into it. Feel free to
submit modules for addition into the core, tweak the code to suite your needs and add any features I have not thought
of yet. If you do use this framework we would appreciate you any credit given and would like if you could like back to
this page. Addittionally if you happen to write code that improves on what I have already created, please feel free to
share back! We will appreciate any assistance! Thanks and Enjoy!
